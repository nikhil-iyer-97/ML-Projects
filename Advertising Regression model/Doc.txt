This is a dataset on the sales generated by a company through advertising. Sales of an item are
shown alongside the amount spent on the mode of advertising(TV, Radio, Newspaper) in thousands of
dollars. The task is to predict the sales of an item using the current dataset.

The data was acquired and displayed using pandas. The visualization of data was done using
seaborn visualization toolkit. Linear Regression was used to predict the sales of new items.
The data was split into proportions of 80-20 for training and testing. The model was trained
using the training data and then compared with the tesing data using RMSE testing mechanism.

The results clearly indicated that newspapers contributed little to the awareness about the
items. Thus, the model was trained again using only TV and Radio to check if the model could
be fine-tuned and predict the values more accurately. Results show that the RMSE value 
reduced leading to the conclusion that more money should be spent on advertising through
TV and Radio to increase sales of the item.
