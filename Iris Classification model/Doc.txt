The project is based on classifying the iris dataset available in sklearn using techniques such
as KNN and Logistic Regression. The dataset is a collection on different iris flowers and their
types and their features have been described in the dataset.

The model was initially trained on the entire dataset and asked to classify the dataset by
predicting the class type for the given dataset using KNN and Logistic Regression. The number
of neighbors for KNN classifier was taken as 5. The results were approximately the same as
the actual dataset values.

Train-test-split methodology was adopted and the dataset was broken down into 2 parts of 60%
and 40% proportions for training and testing respectively using the model-selection library.
Both the models were trained on the training data and the accuracy was compared with the testing
data. KNN classifier for 5 neighbors performed better than Logistic Regression and KNN classifier
for 1 neighbor.

Now that it has been established that KNN classifier performs better than Logistic Regression,
the best k value was calculated by modelling the data using k values from 1 to 25. The graph
plotted shows that k values 7,10 and 14 gave maximum accuracy when compared with the testing
data.

The results will vary when tested against a dataset extracted via the train_test_split method
as every time a random dataset is extracted from the actual dataset, the bias-variance tradeoff
is clearly visible when the graph is plotted. Small values of k lead to low bias and high variance
and large values of k lead to high bias and low variance.
